# Use a list comprehension to create tick_names that we will apply to the tick labels. 
# Pick each element `v` from the `tick_props`, and convert it into a formatted string.
# `{:0.2f}` denotes that before formatting, we 2 digits of precision and `f` is used to represent floating point number.
# Refer [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax) for more details
tick_names = ['{:0.2f}'.format(v) for v in tick_props]
